    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>
        Trained in graphic and web design, I transitioned to coding, using
        my design skills to enhance user experiences. I enjoy both frontend
        visuals and backend code, primarily working with PHP, JavaScript,
        and CSS. Familiar with various frameworks and tools, my favorite
        so far is the <a href="https://tallstack.dev">TALL stack</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I value work-life balance and prioritize time with loved ones,
        especially my two dogs. In my free time, I enjoy trivia nights at
        breweries, frisbee in the park, and binge-watching shows with
        my partner.
