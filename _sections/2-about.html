			<p>
				Trained in graphic and web design, I transitioned to coding, using
				my design skills to enhance user experiences. I enjoy both frontend
				visuals and backend code, primarily working with PHP, JavaScript,
				and CSS. Familiar with various frameworks and tools, my favorite
				so far is the <a href="https://tallstack.dev">TALL stack</a>.
			</p>

				I value work-life balance and prioritize time with loved ones,
				especially my two dogs. In my free time, I enjoy trivia nights at
				breweries, frisbee in the park, and binge-watching shows with
				someone special.
